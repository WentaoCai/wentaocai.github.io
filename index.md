### Permutation test for GWAS signals

The Sum-based method for GWAS Signal Enrichment analysis (SumGSE) is a tool to integrate genomic information of biological mechanisms with GWAS summary statistics for complex traits. The sum-based method uses signals of all markers within a pre-defined candidate feature. Briefly, we calculated the following summary statistics for candidate regions. The download and details of SumGSE method could be found [here](https://github.com/WentaoCai/GWAS_enrichment).
